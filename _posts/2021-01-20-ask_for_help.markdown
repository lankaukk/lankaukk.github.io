Something subtle but important to understand about the Getting Started section of SQL: You can ask SQL for help! 

The `.help` command retrieves a complete list of the other SQL commands. This means it's okay if you forget them! As long as you remember `.help` of course.

The list includes some really helpful commands like: `.schema, .header(s) ON|OFF, and .mode MODE ?TABLE?`

The `.schema` command shows the CREATE statements of a table. This reminds you of the table name, the columns in the table as well as the specific type of data each column will store. 

The `.header(s) ON|OFF, and .mode MODE ?TABLE?` commands are so incredibly helpful! They allow you to alter the way the data is displayed. Even if you have a very little amount of data, I found it to be really disorganized and unnatural looking at it the default way, in continuous rows that aren't spaced nicely or go without their column names. Turning on display headers and chaning the mode to *column*, or whichever option you find easiest, makes it so much easier to look at the table and do whatever work needed. Why struggle?

These little things make coding effeciently so much easier!
