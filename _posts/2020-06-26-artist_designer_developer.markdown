The road that let me to coding was not a straight one. I wasn't always "into" computers, at least not more than any other Gen Z-er. But I was always really artistic! I stated painting when I was 8 years old, and still do today. My love for art led me to purse a design degree in college. That is where I learned that art and design are in fact, not synonymous. They are very different concepts, and that is probably a good thing! I thought, design is definitely more practical application for my creative interests anyway. 

At Parsons, is also where I was first introduced to coding. In the communication design major, I was required to take *"Core Interaction"* and *"Creative Computing"* classes. I was blown away by the possibilities of coding. The web is like an infinite canvas. I found myself staring at an empty web page the same way I would stare at an empty canvas before I paint. I still have so many ideas I don't know what to do with them, mostly because I don't yet know how to execute them properly. 

I came to a dead end for learning code in art school. We were taught the basics of HTML, CSS and a littlee bit of Javascript. But for the most part we were taught to focus on concept development and design, in order to pitch our ideas to developers. div class="BOR-ING" I don't want to have to middle-man it like that. If I can keep learning how to develop too, won't that make me a faster, more independent professional in th long run?

So here I am! Seeking an education in software engineering, so that I can build all of the wild applications and websites that my colorful mind comes up with.
