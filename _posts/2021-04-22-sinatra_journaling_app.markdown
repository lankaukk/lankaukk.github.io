For my sinatra app project, I decided to make a journal.  Once you create an account, you can create journal entries, view them, edit them, and delete them. Your journal is totally private, you are the only one who can see it! 

Because users only ever see their own journal entries, this prevents them from being able to edit or delete anyone else's. They can't even see anyone else's entries. 

This project was fun and not nearly as difficult as the labs that came before it. It felt nice to finally take what I had learned from those labs and make something of my own. It is a very basic application, and there are plenty of other feature I would like to add. However, since I have a MVP working, I think the best way to use my time is to go ahead and schedule the assessment for it, and continue going through the cirriculum. I will look into adding additional features while waiting for my assessment. And eventually, when I become more skilled in javascript, I might want to come back to this project and really make it ✨cool ✨
