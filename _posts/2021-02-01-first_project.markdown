This project was a big challenge for me. Up to this point, I had gotten comfortable reading through the lessons, and then completing the labs, asking for help when I needed it. However, moving on to this project was difficult because I didn't have that same instant gratification of completing something so quickly. It was a complete change of pace. 

What I learned the most from this project was not how to build a CLI Ruby Gem, it was** how to stay motivated**. I was so deterred from even starting to work on it that, as a self-paced student, I skipped ahead and completed other modules without projects first. That was my way of retaining the feeling of being productive. I'm glad I was still doing *something*, but I let my Ruby knowledge get rusty. Definitely not the best move. 

When I finally had no choice but to pull myself out of this place of being too intimidated to start building the project, it got easier. Watching the tutorial videos, I learned how to use Bundler, which was a huge step for me because it got my whole file structure set up, and I was way less intimidated. From there, my next challenge was finding an API and then learning how to fetch data from it. I know that this wasn't the main purpose of the project, but it did take me more time to figure out than the actual OO coding unfortunately. Once I got that done, the rest wasn't so difficult. Granted, I had a lot of help from the study groups, and slack, and more tutorial videos. I'm very grateful for all the people who helped me, even just a little bit. It's more important that I realized to just talk to other students. 

Now that I have something working, I am so relieved! My project asks users for a zip code and then returns Breweries located there. I'm not a beer connoisseur by any means, and I wouldn't say this is my favorite thing I've ever made, but I'm really excited to see it working! It actually works!! Wow, what an experience. I will never procrastinate a project like this again.
